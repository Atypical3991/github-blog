## Golang

## Why You Should Use GoLang
### High Concurrency via Goroutines
* Goroutines are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime.
* Ideal for handling thousands of concurrent tasks (e.g., network I/O, APIs).
* Perfect for:
    * High-throughput APIs
    * Streaming systems
    * Real-time services

### Fast Compilation + Performance
* Compiles to native binaries very quickly.
* Performance is close to C/C++, faster than Java in many I/O-bound use cases.

### Simplicity & Minimalism
* A small, clean standard library.
* Easy to read, write, and maintain.
* No inheritance, no complex type systems — easier for teams.

### Great for Cloud-Native Apps
* Popular with Kubernetes, Docker, Prometheus, etc.
* Go binaries are statically linked → great for containerized environments.

### Memory Safe + Garbage Collected
* You get performance with garbage collection.
* Avoids many C/C++ pitfalls like buffer overflows.

### Strong Tooling
* go fmt, go test, go build, and go mod are first-class tools.
* Easy module management and dependency control.

## When You Should Use GoLang
| Use Case                     | Why Go Is a Good Fit                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **High-concurrency servers** | Built-in goroutines and channels            |
| **Microservices/APIs**       | Fast, easy to deploy, scalable              |
| **CLI tools**                | Static binaries, no runtime needed          |
| **Cloud-native development** | Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform use Go        |
| **Edge computing**           | Low memory footprint                        |
| **Streaming & networking**   | Handles millions of connections efficiently |

## Limitations of GoLang
### No Generics (until recently)
* Before Go 1.18, lacked generics — now supported but still maturing.
* Makes writing reusable containers or utility libs verbose.

### Limited Language Features
* No inheritance, no method overloading, no annotations.
* No exceptions — error handling is manual and repetitive (if err != nil).

### Garbage Collector (GC) Overhead
* While fast, still has GC pauses — not ideal for ultra low-latency needs.

### Weak Runtime Reflection
* Reflection is clunky and limited compared to Python or Java.
* Makes dynamic programming (e.g., serialization, meta-programming) harder.

### UI and Mobile Development
* Poor ecosystem for desktop GUI or mobile apps.
* Not a good fit for client-side logic-heavy applications.
