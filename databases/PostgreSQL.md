## When to use PostgreSQL?

Using PostgreSQL is an excellent choice when your application demands a powerful, reliable, and standards-compliant relational database that supports both traditional SQL and modern features like JSON, full-text search, and geospatial data. Below is a comprehensive guide on when and why to use PostgreSQL:

### When You Need a Relational Database with Complex Relationships
PostgreSQL is a classic relational database, which means:
    * You can define foreign keys, constraints, and normalized schemas
    * Ideal for applications where data integrity is critical
Examples:
    * ERP, HR, CRM systems
    * Financial systems (banking, accounting)
    * E-commerce applications with orders, products, customers

### When You Need Full SQL Support and Complex Queries
PostgreSQL supports:  
    * Full ANSI SQL syntax
    * Advanced queries: joins, subqueries, CTEs (Recursive Support), window functions (Custom Window Functions)
    * Stored procedures, triggers, and custom functions
This makes it perfect for:
    * Analytics queries
