# MySQL

## When to Use MySQL
* Structured Relational Data
    * Your data has clear relationships (e.g., users, orders, products).
    * Tables with foreign keys, constraints, and normalized schemas.

    Example: E-commerce platforms, CRMs, inventory systems.

* Strong Data Consistency (ACID)
    * You need reliable transactions, atomic operations, and rollbacks.
    * Ensures consistency in operations like financial transfers or order processing.
     
    Use MySQL when data integrity is critical.

* Complex Queries & Joins
    * You frequently run multi-table queries with JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, etc.
    * You need views, subqueries, and window functions.

    NoSQL databases typically donâ€™t support these well.

* Stable, Low-to-Medium Write Volume
    * Your app has predictable write patterns (e.g., hundreds to thousands per second).
    * Use InnoDB engine for row-level locking and concurrent writes.

* Wide Tooling and Ecosystem Support
    * You need integration with BI tools, ORMs (like Hibernate), or web frameworks (Django, Laravel).
    * Managed MySQL options available (e.g., Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure Database for MySQL).

* Mature Operational Requirements
    * You need stable backups, replication, and failover.
    * MySQL offers:
        * Master-slave or group replication
        * Point-in-time recovery
        * Percona, ProxySQL, and more

## When Not to Use MySQL
* Flexible schema or unstructured data: MongoDB, DynamoDB
* Very high write throughput: Cassandra, ClickHouse
* Distributed, global-scale availability: CockroachDB, Spanner, YugabyteDB
* Efficient time-series handling: InfluxDB, TimescaleDB
* Eventual consistency and partitioning: Cassandra, DynamoDB

## Common Use Cases for MySQL
* E-commerce: Structured product/order/user data
* Content Management Systems: WordPress, Joomla, etc., use MySQL heavily
* ERP/CRM tools	Multi-table: relationships, transactions
* Web & mobile apps	Strong: LAMP/LEMP stack compatibility
* Financial applications: ACID, foreign keys, transaction logs
