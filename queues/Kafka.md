# Kafka High-Throughput Pipeline Architecture

## Partition Strategy: More Partitions = More Parallelism
* Use hundreds to thousands of partitions across many brokers.
* Choose partition keys that evenly distribute data (e.g., hashing IDs).

## Producer Optimization
* Use async, batched, and compressed producers:
    * Compression (e.g., LZ4) reduces network load
    * Linger time + batch size increase batching
    * Multiple producer instances (multi-thread/process)

## Kafka Cluster Design

| Component   | Recommendation                                |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Brokers     | At least **6–10 brokers**, scale as needed    |
| Partitions  | Start with **200–1000+ partitions**           |
| Replication | 2 or 3 (for HA)                               |
| Disk        | SSDs or NVMe (low-latency write performance)  |
| Network     | At least **10 Gbps** per broker               |
| Memory      | 32–128 GB RAM per broker                      |
| Zookeeper   | 3 or 5 nodes (or use **KRaft** in Kafka 3.4+) |

## Consumer Optimization
* Use many consumer threads or instances (1 per partition)
* Enable batching and fetch max bytes:
* Parallelize message processing (e.g., via async workers or thread pools)
* Use idempotent consumers or checkpoints for reliability

## Monitoring & Backpressure Management
* Monitor:
    * Producer metrics: batch size, retries, compression ratio
    * Broker metrics: partition load, disk usage, heap, GC
    * Consumer lag: critical for detecting under-consumption
* Mitigate:
    * Use Kafka lag exporter / Burrow / Prometheus
    * Add more consumers dynamically (auto-scaling)
    * Throttle producers during overload

## How to tune Kafka to handle high read/write traffic

| Component    | Focus                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Producer** | Batching, compression, async I/O |
| **Topic**    | Partition count, replication     |
| **Broker**   | IO threads, buffer sizes, disk   |
| **Consumer** | Fetch sizes, poll tuning         |
| **Hardware** | SSDs, high NIC, memory           |


### Producer Tuning Parameters

| Property                   | Recommended for High Throughput            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `acks=1` or `acks=all`     | `acks=1` is faster; `all` is safer         |
| `linger.ms=10-50`          | Adds delay to batch more messages          |
| `batch.size=32KB - 128KB`  | Larger batches = better compression + I/O  |
| `compression.type=lz4`     | Fast compression; lowers network load      |
| `buffer.memory=64MB+`      | Bigger buffer prevents blocking on bursts  |
| `max.in.flight.requests=5` | Multiple requests in flight per connection |
| `retries=3+`               | Retry failed sends                         |


### Broker Configuration for High Ingest
| Property                           | Notes                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `num.network.threads=8+`           | Handles producer/consumer I/O          |
| `num.io.threads=16+`               | Handles disk and replication I/O       |
| `log.flush.interval.messages=-1`   | Let OS handle flushing                 |
| `log.flush.interval.ms=500`        | Flush periodically, not on every write |
| `socket.send.buffer.bytes=1MB+`    | Larger socket buffers                  |
| `replica.fetch.max.bytes=50MB+`    | High-throughput replication            |
| `replica.fetch.response.max.bytes` | Match your largest expected batch      |
| `log.segment.bytes=512MB - 1GB`    | Larger segments = fewer I/O operations |

### Topic & Partition Tuning
| Setting                     | What It Does                                 |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `partitions=500+`           | More partitions = more parallelism           |
| `replication.factor=2 or 3` | Trade-off between durability and write speed |
| `min.insync.replicas=2`     | Needed for `acks=all`                        |

### Consumer Tuning for High Throughput
| Setting                          | Description                        |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `fetch.min.bytes=32KB+`          | Batches more before fetching       |
| `fetch.max.bytes=50MB+`          | Upper limit on fetch               |
| `max.poll.records=5000+`         | Control number of records per poll |
| `max.partition.fetch.bytes=1MB+` | Per partition buffer               |

### Hardware Recommendations
| Component   | Recommendation                            |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Disk**    | NVMe or SSDs (avoid HDD)                  |
| **Network** | 10 Gbps+                                  |
| **Memory**  | 32–128 GB RAM                             |
| **CPU**     | 8–16 vCPUs per broker                     |
| **Storage** | At least 2–3× retention size + compaction |

### How to Estimate Number of Brokers
#### Key factors:
* Write throughput (MB/s)
* Retention period
* Replication factor
* Disk IO capacity per broker
* Max CPU/memory per broker

Formula for deciding number of Brokers

Total cluster throughput = Messages/sec × Avg Message Size × Replication Factor
Per broker capacity = 50–200 MB/s (write) depending on hardware
Brokers = Total cluster write throughput / Broker capacity
