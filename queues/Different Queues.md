# Top Highly Distributed Queues for Scalable Event Systems

## Apache Kafka 
The industry standard for distributed event streaming

| Feature                   | Description                                   |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Log-based               | Append-only, ordered logs (great for replay)  |
| ✅ Horizontal scalability  | Partitioned topics, sharded consumers         |
| ✅ Durability              | Messages persisted to disk with replication   |
| ✅ Ecosystem               | Kafka Connect, Streams, kSQL, Schema Registry |
| ✅ Exactly-once (optional) | Transactional producers/consumers             |

Use when:
* You need event sourcing or stream processing
* Scale and durability are top priorities
* You want a huge open-source ecosystem

## Apache Pulsar
Kafka alternative with better multi-tenancy, geo-replication, and tiered storage
| Feature               | Description                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Multi-tenant native | Built-in tenant and topic isolation       |
| ✅ Tiered storage      | Offload older data to S3, GCS, etc.       |
| ✅ Geo-replication     | Multi-cluster sync without external tools |
| ✅ Topic compaction    | Keep latest state per key                 |
| ✅ Push + pull models  | More flexible than Kafka                  |

Use when:
Lightweight pub/sub with optional persistence and streaming

| Feature             | Description                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Low latency       | Sub-millisecond round-trips           |
| ✅ JetStream mode    | Adds durability, replay, backpressure |
| ✅ Global clustering | Leaf nodes, superclusters             |
| ✅ Simplicity        | Lightweight binary, easy deployment   |

Use when:
* You need fast, simple messaging
* You have IoT or edge workloads
* You want streaming + request-reply

Kafka-compatible, ultra-fast event streaming engine in C++
| Feature                | Description                         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| ✅ Kafka API compatible | Drop-in Kafka replacement           |
| ✅ No JVM               | Written in C++ for high performance |
| ✅ Single binary        | Easy to deploy and scale            |
| ✅ Disk persistence     | Durable and recoverable logs        |

Use when:
* You want Kafka-like capabilities with lower resource use
* You’re deploying to Kubernetes or bare-metal

## RabbitMQ (with Shovel/Federation)
Traditional message broker — can be distributed but not ideal at massive scale

| Feature               | Description                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| ✅ Rich routing        | Topic, header, fanout exchanges |
| ✅ Plugin ecosystem    | Federation, Shovel, clustering  |
| ✅ Multiple protocols  | AMQP, MQTT, STOMP               |
| ⚠️ Throughput limited | By disk IO and memory           |

Use when:
* You need complex routing logic
* You have moderate scale + business messaging

## Google Cloud Pub/Sub / AWS Kinesis / Azure Event Hubs
Cloud-native scalable messaging platforms

| Feature            | Description                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Serverless scale | No infra to manage                       |
| ✅ Durability       | High availability and persistent storage |
| ✅ Easy integration | IAM + service ecosystem                  |

Use when:
* You're 100% in the cloud
* You need zero management overhead
* You prefer pay-as-you-go pricing
